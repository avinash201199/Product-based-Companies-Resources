Having a LinkedIn profile will help you a great deal in landing your dream job. And the sooner you have it, the better it will be for your career.
A well-written LinkedIn profile will give you credibility and will establish you as a trustworthy potential employee. Every time a recruiter contacts you, you can be sure that they’ve looked at your profile. Your LinkedIn profile will act as a validator in that you are a real person, and not someone whose CV or resume is too good to be true.

#### You should have the following things to be added to your LinkedIn profile.

1- Your headline - Your LinkedIn headline is key to making a positive impression and explaining exactly what you bring to the table. It’s also one of the most important fields for LinkedIn’s search algorithm. Not only should your LinkedIn headline portray you as a credible member of your industry, but it should also contain strategic keywords that help you appear higher in LinkedIn searches.<br>

2- Your “about” section - This is where you tell your story. It’s a place to talk about Why you do what you do, What you do, How you do it, and list some of your accomplishments.<br>
Describe what makes you tick. Explain your present role. Frame your past. Highlight your successes. Reveal your character. Show life outside of work<br>

3- Your Profile pictures - When you dress sharply for a job interview, you’re telling the employer you mean business before even speaking a word. In the same vein, taking a few simple steps to improve the quality and polish of your profile photo on LinkedIn can go a long way toward sending the right signals to anyone who happens across you on the platform.<br>

4- Your experiences and a short description of them - Of all the sections of your LinkedIn profile, the Experience area is the most important one for recruiters and hiring managers. Write a good summary using two or three sentences to give the best overview of the experience, key accomplishments, and relevant industry expertise.<br>

5- Your education - Keep it professional with the schools/colleges/universities which really matter and relate to your profession. Enter any extracurricular activities you participated in while attending that school/college in the Activities and Societies text box. Enter any awards or honors you received from the school/college in the Description, Add rich media such as photos, videos, links, or documents to showcase your proud moments while attending that school.<br>

6- Your skills - While you want to list a lot of skills, you also want to list the right skills. Take a look at profiles for similar job titles in your industry. Target skills that appear in their Skills & Endorsements sections.<br>

7- Your interests - Surprising as it may seem, the Interests section of your LinkedIn Profile carries more weight than you think. It connects you to your recruiter or reader on a more personal level. It might give them that little reason to meet you and know you further on a deeper level. <br>

8- What you talk about (under your headline)- The talk about section is a very essential feature of letting your connections or potential employers, and employees comprehend what the profile is all about.<br>

9- Your featured posts - The Featured section is a place for you to showcase some of your posts and articles, or even add photos, documents, and links for others to see. It shows up just below your 'About' section so it's likely to capture profile viewers' attention.<br>

10- Your certifications and Courses done by you - Adding courses on LinkedIn and completing an online certification shows personal drive and discipline, intellectual maturity, curiosity, and a strong willingness to learn: all important aspects to employers.<br>

11- Your volunteering experiences - Add relevant volunteer experience to round out your professional story, and highlight board or nonprofit work.<br>

12- Skill endorsements - Endorsements are a feature on LinkedIn that allows you and your connections to endorse each other for certain skills. Being endorsed in a skill shows recruiters that others have observed your proficiency in that area, which increases your credibility.<br>

13- Recommendations- The list of recommendations from senior officials and clients on your profile affirming your skills and work styles will enhance your profile and provide a social authenticity to claim your expertise to others.<br>

14- Awards - The awards and honors section on LinkedIn is a specified category for you to enter in your achievements. The awards and honors category will likely attract them. And so, making detailed and accurate entries on your profile is a boost to your Linkedin profile.<br>

15- Languages - To be able to speak different languages in the workplace is undoubtedly an excellent advantage that will place you a cut above those who only manage one.<br>

<br>
LinkedIn also offers you an excellent opportunity to network with other professionals in your field. And the faster you start this networking, the better it will be down the line. Regardless of whether you currently are working, you can make use of your network of connections if you are looking for other employment.
